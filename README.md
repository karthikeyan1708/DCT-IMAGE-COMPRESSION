# DCT-IMAGE-COMPRESSION

Image compression focuses mainly minimizing the size in bytes of an image file without considerable change in the quality of the image.  Implement Image compression using Discrete Cosine Theorem mainly focuses on different steps such as Quantization, zigzag scanning, encoding and different evaluating parameters which play vital process in this compression phase.
